I've owned this eponymous domain for a while. It's my plot of digital real estate with enough intrinsic value to let auto-renew run its course every year on my credit card.Â 

This site has seen many iterations. In college, I built a site at these internet coordinates that served as my interactive resume. For a while, it was a dead link. For a short period, I had a plain HTML landing page that routed to my LinkedIn. Now, until the next version of gusgoetze.com, I will use this space as a collection of thoughts, essays, and research. I may post once. I may post hundreds of times. I don't have plans of monetization or even sharing. It's public but without promotion. So if you found this, consider yourself a modern day treasure hunter.

A bit about me, since that's why you're on this tab:

* Based in Chicago, IL
* Work in corporate strategy & product management
* Fitness junkie
* I read about technology and markets
* I enjoy the outdoors and traveling
* Tinkerer, mostly digital but with physical aspirations
