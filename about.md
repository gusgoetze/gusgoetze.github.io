I've owned this domain for a while. It's my eponymous plot of digital real estate, evolving with each iteration.


In college, this site was an interactive resume. Then, it was a dead link. For a short period, a simple HTML landing page redirecting to my LinkedIn. Now, until the next version of gusgoetze.com ermerges, this space will be home to a collection of thoughts, essays, and prose. I might post once. I might post hundreds of times. I have no plans to monetize or promote it. It's public, but unadvertised. If you've stumbled across it, consider yourself a modern-day treasure hunter.

A bit about me:

* Based in Chicago, IL
* Work in corporate strategy & product management
* Fitness junkie
* Curious about technology, markets, and life itself
* I enjoy the outdoors and traveling
