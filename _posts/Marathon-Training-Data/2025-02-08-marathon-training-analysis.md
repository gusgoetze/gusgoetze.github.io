description: A detailed look at my Garmin data from 5 months of marathon training.

### At the Starting Line

The air is cool. The city hums with nervous energy as the sun rises. 50,000 runners stand at the start line, anxiously awaiting what’s next. I think back to 23 weeks earlier, when I went for my first training run—a three-mile jog through Lincoln Park. Now, 786 training miles later, the starting gun fires. Time to run.

With the marathon behind me and a medal in hand, my proudest accomplishment isn’t my finish time—it’s the discipline and consistency I maintained throughout training. This post breaks down my training plan in detail. Enjoy the data dump.

### Training Philosophy & Schedule
This wasn’t my first marathon. I ran my first in 2023, but between October 2023 and May 2024, I focused on strength training—caloric surpluses, heavy lifts, and low reps. To maintain some level of cardio fitness, I ran two miles on the treadmill before each lifting session. Ten miles per week wasn’t much, but it kept my legs from completely resetting.

Then, in May, marathon training began. I shifted my approach entirely—lifting no longer centered around strength; instead, it was about complementing my running performance. Every decision—cross-training, recovery, warm-ups, diet—was made with one goal: run faster, run stronger.

| Day of the Week | AM Workout                            | PM Workout     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Monday          | 45 min of spin<br>60 min push workout | None           |
| Tuesday         | 90 minute pull workout                | 3-5 mile run   |
| Wednesday       | 5-10 mile run                         | 30 minute yoga |
| Thursday        | 90 minute leg workout                 | 3-5 mile run   |
| Friday          | 5-10 mile speed run<br>30 minute core | None           |
| Saturday        | None                                  | None           |
| Sunday          | 7-20 mile long run                    | None           |

### Mileage Progression & Strength Reduction
My mileage climbed steadily—starting at 23 miles per week and increasing by 6% per week until peaking at 50 miles in Week 16.

In the early weeks (when weekly mileage hovered in the 20s and 30s), I maintained most of my major lifts—benching in the mid-200s, squatting in the low 300s, deadlifting in the low 400s. But as mileage ramped up, strength declined. Part of this was intentional. Trying to ego lift the equivalent of a baby elephant was an easy way to get injured.

The trade-off was worth it — I was running faster and more efficiently.

##### Mileage by Day: A Closer Look


![Mileage By Day Graph](/assets/img/Marathon/mileageByDay.png)

Mileage varied throughout the week, and each day had a specific role:

* **Tuesdays & Thursdays:** Consistent mileage with a mid-training bump in late June.
* **Wednesdays & Fridays:** Mirrored each other, but Friday’s were speed-focused tempo runs.
* **Sundays:** Long, steady-state efforts, mostly around 9:30 min/mi, with a few at 8:45 min/mi for my peak 20-mile runs.
* **Friday Tempo Avg Pace:** 7:08 min/mi
* **Wednesday Run Avg Pace:** 8:35 min/mi


![Scatter plot of pace and mileage](/assets/img/Marathon/paceByDay.png)

Fridays were my fastest days. Some four-mile efforts flirted with 6:30 min/mi. More impressive (in my humble opinion)? A 10-mile run at 6:40 min/mi.

### Early Bird Gets the Worm

I'm a morning person. The best part of training is watching the sun rise over Lake Michigan. Here’s how my runs broke down by time of day:

![Start Times per Run](/assets/img/Marathon/runsByHour.png)

* **63% of my runs** started before 8:00 AM
* **Earliest Run:** 3:57 AM (lol)
* **Latest Run:** 7:20 PM
* **32% of runs** were after 3:00 PM, typically when I lifted in the mornings.


![Cumulative time running per hour](/assets/img/Marathon/timeByHour.png)

I spent a cumulative 31 hours and 4 minutes running between the hours of 5:00 and 6:00 AM. This proves that I wasn't rolling out of bed and starting my runs at 5:59 AM. It does prove however, that my one run that started between 3:00 AM and 3:59 AM actually started at 3:57 AM. Does that still count as early?


### Heart Rate Data: Zone 2 or Nah?

They say Zone 2 running is the key to building an anaerobic base, and while I agree, I also think Zone 2 is as much a feeling as it is a number. It’s about running comfortably—being able to talk without gasping. According to my Garmin, that landed me in Zone 3 most of the time, with an average pace of 8:30-9:30 min/mi.

![Heart rate zone chart](/assets/img/Marathon/hrZoneTime.png)

* **Zone 2:** 12.3% of my time. Less than most running blogs would recommend
* **Zone 5:** 4 hours, 36 minutes- courtesy of my Friday "balls to the wall" runs

My absolute minimum heart rate on a run? 50 bpm on July 14. I started this day at 5:21 AM, when the weather was cool and cloudy. In fact, just 51 seconds in, my heart rate spikes to 102 bpm and then ends up averaging 126 bpm for the entire 14.06 mile run.

![Route map of my lowest heart rate run](/assets/img/Marathon/lowestHrMap.png)

My highest heart rate recorded was 176 bpm on September 13, 2024. On this day, I ran 6.03 miles at a 6:43 min/mi pace. It was 70 degrees with 64% humidity. In that last kick, when my heart rate peaked, I was running at a 5:55 min/mi pace.

In this map of my run, green means lower heart rate, red is higher heart rate. I was really pushing it!

### Speed Analysis

My fastest mile was on September 20, when I clipped a mile at a 6:30 min/mi pace on a 10 mile run. 

My top speed, however, was 13.44 mph or a 4:28 min/mi pace. I probably held this only for a few seconds, likely at the end of a Friday run. Needless to say, I didn't do that.

My slowest mile was run at a 9:39 min/mi pace, on October 9, just 4 days before the marathon. On that run, which lasted 39 minutes and 3 seconds, my heart rate was in true Zone 2 for 95% of the time.

Here are some other fun speed stats. Note, these runs aren't mutually exclusive. My fastest 5k and 10k time, for example, are the same run:


| Fastest 5k Times         | Date         |
| :----------------------- | :----------- |
| 20min 37s                | July 5       |
| 20min 49s                | October 4    |
| 20min 56s                | August 9     |
| **Fastest 10k Times**    | **Date**     |
| 42min 5s                 | July 5       |
| 42min 15s                | September 20 |
| 43min 2s                 | June 28      |
| **Fastest 13.1mi Times** | **Date**     |
| 2hr 0min 24s             | September 15 |
| 2hr 0min 53s             | July 7       |
| 2hr 3min 13s             | September 1  |


### Feed The Beast

Marathon training burns a ridiculous amount of calories. Especially with strict cross training and frequent 2-a-day workouts, you'll easily find yourself in a caloric deficit if you don't intentionally fuel up.

* **Lowest calories burned:** 339 kcal (easly 2.35 mile shakeout)
* **Most calories burned:** 2,850 kcal (20.04 miles in 75 degree heat)
* **Average calories burned per run:** 933 kcal

This doesn't count ~800 kcal I'd burn every spin session, the ~600 kcal I'd burn every weightlifting session, and the ~2000-2500 kcal I'd burn just by going about life.


### Total Stats & Maps

* **Total Runs:** 113
* **Total Mileage:** 786.62 miles
* **Total Time Spent Running:** 110 hours, 29 minutes, 41 seconds
* **Total Time Spent Paused:** 3 hours, 20 minutes, 13 seconds (red lights, gels, water fountains, port-o-potty visits)

### Marathon Stats

I want to write another post about my marathon day experience, but since this is the data dump of my training, it's only right that I also pull some quick stats from my fateful 26.2 mile race through the streets of Chicago.


| Data Point                  | Value                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Start Time                  | 8:19:05 AM            |
| Distance                    | 26.84 mi              |
| Fastest Mile                | 7:15 min/mi (mile 4)  |
| Slowest Mile                | 8:11 min/mi (mile 27) |
| Calories Burned             | 4066 kcal             |
| Official Half Marathon Time | 1:43:10               |
| Official Marathon Time      | 3:28:54               |
| Garmin Half Marathon Time   | 1:39:45               |
| Garmin Marathon Time        | 3:24:00               |

My heart rate in the marathon was also cooked. Nerves and excitement had me in zone 3 just standing at the start line. Standing! As a result, once I actually started *running* I shot up to zone 5 and stayed there for most of the race, for an average rate of 167 bpm. It was worth the sub 3:30 finish.

### Reflecting on The Journey

Marathon day was amazing. In my first marathon, I got emotional when I saw mile 26 signs above me, knowing that I just had to kick an extra 0.2 miles to cross the finish line. This year, however, I was much more emotional on September 22. On this 75 degree Sunday, with a steady, light rain coming down, I logged my final 20 mile run of the training block. It was peak week. The third of 3, 50 mile weeks. From here on, for the next 3 weeks, I'd be tapering. It was only going to get easier. As the rain came down, raindrops mixed with tears. Subtle weeps, juxtaposed with conspicuous "Let's GO's" from me, to me, occupied my headspace. I was so proud. The hard work was done.

Training is the hard part. Race day is the celebration. I truly believe anyone can run a marathon. When you push yourself, find your limits, and grind it out, the results are beautiful.

While I'm proud of the medal and the finish time achieved, I'm more proud of the 113 runs that got me there.
