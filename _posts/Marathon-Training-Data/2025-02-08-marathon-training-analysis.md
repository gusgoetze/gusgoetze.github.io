description: A detailed look at my Garmin data from 5 months of marathon training.
---

The air is cool, the city starts to buzz with energy as the sun rises and 50,000 people anxiously await what's next. I think back to 23 weeks earlier, when I went for my first training run: a 3 mile,  jog through Lincoln Park. 786 training miles later, the starting gun fires. Time to run.

Now, with the marathon behind me and a medal in hand, my proudest accomplishment isn't my finish time, but the discipline and consistency maintained during training. In this post, I'll break down my training plan in detail- enjoy!

### Training Philosophy & Schedule
I also ran a marathon in 2023. From October 2023-May 2024, I tried to put on as much strength as possible. How? Caloric surpluses, extra protein, heavy weight, and low rep ranges. To maintain some cardio fitness, I would run 2 miles on the treadmill before each lifting session. My 10 miles of weekly volume didn't get me into running shape, but it prevented me from completely resetting progress.

In May, marathon training began. Instead of lifting for strength, I focused on lifting to become a better runner. All cross-training, recovery, warmup and diet decisions were made around optimizing for running performance.

| Day of the Week | AM Workout                            | PM Workout     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Monday          | 45 min of spin<br>60 min push workout | None           |
| Tuesday         | 90 minute pull workout                | 3-5 mile run   |
| Wednesday       | 5-10 mile run                         | 30 minute yoga |
| Thursday        | 90 minute leg workout                 | 3-5 mile run   |
| Friday          | 5-10 mile speed run<br>30 minute core | None           |
| Saturday        | None                                  | None           |
| Sunday          | 7-20 mile long run                    | None           |

### Mileage Progression and Strength Reduction

Mileage climbed, starting at 23 miles, growing by 6% each week until peaking at 50 miles in week 16. 

![Weekly Mileage](/assets/img/Marathon/weeklyMileage.png)

I lifted 3 days per week while training. In the first half of the block, when weekly mileage was hovering in the mid 20s-30s, I was able to maintain most of my primary lifts. I continued to bench in the mid 200s, squat in the low 300s, and deadlift in the low 400s. As mileage ramped up, my strength reduced. Part of this was intentional: I didn't want to risk pulling a muscle trying to ego lift the equivalent of a baby elephant. By focusing on running, I was lifting half as much as I usually do and as a result, I was losing strength gains. Everything was going according to plan, since I was running much faster with better endurance. It was worth the trade off.

### Breaking Down Each Day of the Week

As mentioned in the table above, each day of the week had a workout scheduled. In the next graph, you can see how my mileage per day of the week changed over time:

![Mileage By Day Graph](/assets/img/Marathon/mileageByDay.png)

Tuesday's and Thursday's were in sync the whole training period, save for a late June bump when Thursday's added an extra mile more than Tuesdays. Wednesdays and Friday's were also mirrors of each other. The difference, though, is that Friday's were tempo runs. My average pace on Friday tempos was 7:08 min/mi. My average pace on Wednesdays was 8:35 min/mi.

Depending on the distance, my pace changed. It's not linear though. Yes, my Sunday long runs were slower, but there were also short runs that I ran slowly, and longer runs I moved fast. Plots in the top right corner suggest long distance, slower pace. Bottom left are short distance, faster pace. 

![Scatter plot of pace and mileage](/assets/img/Marathon/paceByDay.png)

On Friday's we went fast, really pushing it. You can see I had some 4 mile runs close to a 6:30 min/mi average pace. What's more impressive, in my humble opinion, is the 10 mile run at around a 6:40 min/mi pace.

Sunday long runs held steady around 9:30 min/mi. You can see I also decided to go a bit faster, around 8:45 min/mi for 2, 20 mile runs.

### Early Bird Gets The Worm

I'm a morning person. You don't waste a second of daylight when you witness the sun rise over Lake Michigan. In the summer, this means some pretty early starts.

Here are the number of runs I had that started within each hour:

![Start Times per Run](/assets/img/Marathon/runsByHour.png)

63% of my runs started before 8 AM. 36% of my runs started sometime between 5:00 AM and 5:59 AM. Typically, on days where I lifted and ran, I would lift in the morning and go for my run after work. 32% of my runs were after 3pm. I had 3 runs that fell in the middle of the day.

Here is a similar cut of the data that shows the cumulative amount of time I spent running within each hour.

![Cumulative time running per hour](/assets/img/Marathon/timeByHour.png)

This means that of the 36% of my runs that happened sometime between 5:00 AM and 5:59AM, I spent a total of 31 hours and 4 minutes running in that time block. This proves that I wasn't just starting my runs at 5:59AM. It does prove however, that my one run that started between 3:00 AM and 3:59 AM actually started at 3:57 AM. Does that still count as early? These data show a preference for long, early morning runs. Anything in the afternoon is shorter distance, by almost 3x. The latest run I had started at 7:20 PM.


### Heart Rate Data

They say zone 2 running is the key to building an anaerobic base. I agree, but it's also hard to stick to zone 2. I started to adopt the philosophy that "zone 2" is more of a feeling than a number. Run at a pace where you could hold a conversation; run on cruise control, where you could go for hours. This doesn't mean it's a cake walk, but it you should never need to stop to catch your breath. For me, that pace, which ended up being somewhere around 8:30-9:30 min/mi, depending on the day, put me in zone 3 most of the time according to my Garmin. Here's the distribution of my time spent in each heart rate zone:

![Heart rate zone chart](/assets/img/Marathon/hrZoneTime.png)

It's a far cry from the zone 2 mandate that most running blogs preach. Oh, and zone 5? You can thank my Friday "balls to the wall" sprints for those cumulative 4 hours and 36 minutes.

I pulled some other interesting heart rate stats. My absolute minimum heart rate on a run? 50 bpm on July 14. I started this day at 5:21 AM. I was likely had only taken a step. Weather was 70 degrees and cloudy. In fact, just 51 seconds in, my heart rate spikes to 102 bpm and then ends up averaging 126 bpm for the entire 14.06 mile run.

![Route map of my lowest heart rate run](/assets/img/Marathon/lowestHrMap.png)

My highest maximum heart rate was 176 bpm on September 13, 2024. On this day, I ran 6.03 miles at a 6:43 min/mi pace. It was 70 degrees with 64% humidity. In that last kick, when my heart rate peaked, I was running at a 5:55 min/mi pace.

In this map of my run, green means lower heart rate, red is high heart rate. I was really pushing it!

### Speed Analysis

I mentioned that Friday's were my speed days. My fastest mile was on September 20, when I clipped a mile at a 6:30 min/mi pace on a 6:35 AM 10 mile run. It was mile 3 of 10. My top speed, however, was 13.44 mph (date unknown). I probably held this only for a few seconds, likely at the end of a Friday run. If I held this pace, I would run 1 mile in 4 minutes and 28 seconds. Needless to say, I didn't do that.

My slowest mile was at a 9:39 min/mi pace, which I did on October 9, just 4 days before the marathon. On that run, which lasted 39 minutes and 3 seconds, my heart rate was in zone 2 for 95% of the time.

Some other fun speed stats. Note, these runs aren't mutually exclusive. My fastest 5k and 10k time, for example, are the same run:


| Fastest 5k Times         | Date         |
| :----------------------- | :----------- |
| 20min 37s                | July 5       |
| 20min 49s                | October 4    |
| 20min 56s                | August 9     |
| **Fastest 10k Times**    | **Date**     |
| 42min 5s                 | July 5       |
| 42min 15s                | September 20 |
| 43min 2s                 | June 28      |
| **Fastest 13.1mi Times** | **Date**     |
| 2hr 0min 24s             | September 15 |
| 2hr 0min 53s             | July 7       |
| 2hr 3min 13s             | September 1  |


### Feed The Beast

You have to eat a lot when marathon training. Especially with strict cross training and frequent 2-a-day workouts, you'll easily find yourself in a caloric deficit if you don't intentionally fuel up.

The fewest calories I burned on a run was 339 kcal on October 11, which was an easy 2.35 mi shakeout run 2 days before the marathon.

The most calories I burned was 2850 kcal, where I ran 20.04 miles along the Lake Front Trail at an average pace of 9:28 min/mi. It was 75 degrees (HOT) and took me 3 hours, 9 minutes and 45 seconds.

On average, over the course of training, I burned 933 kcal per run. Again, this is just per run. It doesn't count ~800 kcal I'd burn every spin session, the ~600 kcal I'd burn every weightlifting session, and the ~2000-2500 kcal I'd burn just by going about life.


### Total Stats & Maps

All said and done, I had 113 training runs. I covered 786.62 miles of ground. I spend 110 hours, 29 minutes, and 41 seconds slamming my feet against concrete, asphalt, gravel, dirt, grass, rubber, or anything solid beneath me. Additionally, I had spent 3 hours, 20 minutes, and 13 seconds paused at red lights, going #2 is post-Bears-game porto-potties, paused at the edge of Burnham park watching the city shine from the south, paused to rip a gel, or paused to slurp some water.

It's hard to visualize 786.62 miles, so I created <a href="/trainingradius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this map</a>. It draws a circle with a radius of equal mileage from Chicago. It shows just how far you could go if you walked - or ran - 786.62 miles in any direction, and where in North America you might end up.

What's coolest, though, is seeing all 113 runs web through the streets of Chicago. <a href="/2024trainingmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a>, you can see shows all my running routes superimposed on one map. From the Yacht Harbor by Soldier Field, to the Dickens Greenway, from Manhattan Beach in Southern California to a 1.2 mile loop we ran a mind numbing 16 times in a row in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, you can view all my routes in the world.


### Marathon Stats

I want to write another post about my marathon day experience, but since this is the data dump of my training, it's only right that I also pull some quick stats from my fateful 26.2 mile race through the streets of Chicago.


| Data Point                  | Value                 |

| Fastest Mile                | 7:15 min/mi (mile 4)  |
| Slowest Mile                | 8:11 min/mi (mile 27) |
| Calories Burned             | 4066 kcal             |
| Official Half Marathon Time | 1:43:10               |
| Official Marathon Time      | 3:28:54               |

| Garmin Marathon Time        | 3:24:00               |

My heart rate in the marathon was also cooked. Nerves and excitement had me in zone 3 just standing at the start line. Standing! As a result, once I actually started *running* I shot up to zone 5 and stayed there for most of the race, for an average rate of 167 bpm. It was worth the sub 3:30 finish.

### Reflecting on The Journey

Marathon day was amazing. In my first marathon, I got emotional when I saw mile 26 signs above me, knowing that I just had to kick an extra 0.2 miles until I cross the finish line. This year, however, I was much more emotional on September 22. On this 75 degree Sunday, with a steady, light rain coming down, I logged my final 20 mile run of the training block. It was peak week. The third of 3, 50 mile weeks. From here on, for the next 3 weeks, I'd be tapering. It was only going to get easier. As the rain came down, raindrops mixed with tears. Subtle weeps, juxtaposed with conspicuous "Let's GO's" from me, to me, occupied my headspace. I was so proud. The hard work was done.

Race day is just the celebration. The training is the hard part. The discipline is the hard part. The accountability is the hard part. I truly believe anyone can run a marathon. In fact, you don't even need to have a maniacal plan to finish. If you want to push yourself, to find your limits, and to see what you can accomplish when you grind it out, the results can be beautiful.

While I'm proud of the medal hanging and the goal time achieved, I'm more proud of the 113 runs that got me there.
