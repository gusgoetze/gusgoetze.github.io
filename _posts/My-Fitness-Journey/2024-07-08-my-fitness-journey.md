#### Humble Beginnings

From my senior year of high school through my sophomore year of college, I could inhale food without consequence. Daily breakfast burritos from the frat house chef? No problem. Late-night pizza? Bring it on. A dozen beers before noon on a game day? barely made a dent. I could consume an entire pound of pasta loaded with sauce and cheese and feel perfectly fine the next morning. My body was a furnace, burning through calories with zero consequences.

Looking back, I realize why - I was growing six inches over those three years and packing on 75 pounds of bone and muscle. My body needed the fuel.


Like most college freshmen, I eventually found my way into the campus weight room. In packs of 3-4, we‚Äôd graze shyly around the gym while upperclassmen - guys will full beards, chalked hands, and intimidating grunts - tossed around 500-pound weights like they were nothing. Even standing in the corner, I felt in the way. Working out wasn‚Äôt something I needed to do; I was metabolizing food at an incredibly efficient rate. Sure, I knew working out was ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, but at that point, I didn't really care.

I had zero consistency. If you counted pickup basketball, I worked out maybe once or twice per week. Maybe.

Then sophomore year hit and my metabolism slowed down. I wasn‚Äôt¬†_fat_, but I could no longer consume 4,000 calories per day and burn 4,000 calories by just existing. My height had plateaued (I'll take 6'3"!), and my body didn‚Äôt need that kind of fuel. For the first time, I had to be intentional about my fitness.

#### Summer 2019: The First Shift

That Summer, I interned in Austin, Texas, and started working out regularly at the Apple gym. It became part of my daily routine‚Äîa way to structure my day around something consistent. This was key. By making workouts automatic, I eliminated the need to debate whether or not I‚Äôd go. I just went.

That consistency carried over into my senior year of college. I started gaining muscle and getting stronger. My diet? Still questionable. It‚Äôs hard to achieve peak nutrition when your food groups consist of pizza, beer, and whatever was left in the fridge. But at least I was in the gym.


Then COVID hit. Gyms shut down, and I moved back home to Barrington indefinitely.

#### Spring 2020: The Running Experiment 

Like most people, I adapted. I had access to a home gym with dumbbells and a weight machine, but I also took up running. With nothing but time on my hands, I fell into a fitness rabbit hole online. That‚Äôs when I discovered the ‚Äúhybrid athlete‚Äù concept‚Äîsomeone who lifts heavy and runs far.

I had the lifting part down. The running? Not so much.

At that point, I had never run more than two consecutive miles. But I bought a pair of Nike Pegasus and started. My strategy? Run as fast and as far as possible. Looking back, it was stupid. My progression jumped from two miles one week to ten the next‚Äîcompletely ignoring the 10% weekly increase rule.

That summer, I capped things off with a half marathon. No training plan, no structured prep‚Äîjust sheer curiosity to see if I could do it. With zero knowledge of hydration or nutrition, I somehow finished in 1 hour and 58 minutes. Barely.¬†[1]

#### Fall 2020-2022: Strength Takes Over

That summer sparked my interest in optimizing fitness‚Äînutrition, recovery, load balancing. But after the half marathon, I pivoted back to strength training. I focused on getting as strong as possible, running only sporadically. By 2021 and 2022, I had essentially stopped running altogether.

But I was strong. Bench: 300 lbs. Squat: 405 lbs. Deadlift: 415 lbs.

#### Spring 2023: The Next Chapter

Running had started as a mix of curiosity and necessity when gyms were closed. It wasn‚Äôt until spring 2023 that I seriously picked it back up‚Äîthis time, training for my first Chicago Marathon. But that‚Äôs a story for another time.
