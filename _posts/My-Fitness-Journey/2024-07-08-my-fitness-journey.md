From my senior year of high school through sophomore year of college, I could inhale food without consequence. Daily breakfast burritos from the frat house chef, late-night pizza, a dozen beers before noon on a game day, the occasional home-cooked meal consisting of a pound of pasta, sauce, and cheese, whatever it was, my body would digest food like compost. No repercussions. What a dream. Looking back, it‚Äôs because I was sprouting 6 inches over those 3 years and simultaneously amassing 75 pounds of proportional bone and muscle.

<hr>

Like most young men during their freshman year of college, I wandered into the weight room. In packs of 3-4, we‚Äôd graze shyly around the gym, watching as upperclassmen with full beards, chalked hands, and commanding grunts, threw around 500 lbs like a paperweight. Even standing in the corner, I felt in the way. Working out wasn‚Äôt something I needed to do ‚Äî I was metabolizing food at an incredibly efficient rate. I knew it was ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù, but so what?

I lacked consistency. I probably worked out once a week, less than that if you don‚Äôt count playing pickup hoops.

It caught up to me during sophomore year. I wasn‚Äôt¬†_fat_, but I could no longer consume 4,000 calories per day and burn 4,000 calories by just existing. My height had topped out, so my body didn‚Äôt need as much fuel. Now, for the first time, I needed to be intentional in my fitness.¬†¬†

Transition to Summer 2019 and I‚Äôm living in Austin, Texas, for an internship. I became a regular at the Apple gym. Appending a workout to a day in the office provided a convenient way to ensure consistency. This would be key; reserving time every day, at the same time every day, would turn a sporadic chore into an automatic habit.

This consistency persisted beyond the internship and into my senior year of college. I started to put on more muscle and build strength. I was still largely missing the diet component of a healthy lifestyle, but it‚Äôs hard to achieve this on a food pyramid of pizza and beer. Nonetheless, I stayed consistent in the gym.

  <hr>

Then, COVID broke out and gyms shut down. I relocated from LA back to Barrington in March for an indefinite period of time. I was lucky to have access to a home gym inclusive of some dumbbells and a universal weight machine. Like most people, I also turned to the great outdoors. I started running.

With 24 hours of daily free time as the world was shutting down, I fell down some internet rabbit holes of fitness. The ‚Äúhybrid-athlete‚Äù phenomenon was one that resonated most. A hybrid-athlete is someone who lifts heavy and runs far. Now, at this point in my life, I had never run more than 2 miles in a row. So I had the first part down, but needed to start running.

I bought a pair of Nike Pegasus ‚Äî an egalitarian, gateway running shoe. I started. Running as fast as possible for as long as I possibly could. A strategy which, in retrospect, was stupid. My¬†¬†progression went from 2 mile runs one week to 10 miles the next. A far cry from the 10% week over week increase rule of thumb. The summer was capped with a 13.1 mile run through the streets of Tower Lakes. I didn‚Äôt follow a training plan. I just wanted to see if I could do it. Without proper nutrition or hydration, I did. I finished in 1 hour and 58 minutes. Barely.¬†[1]

It was during summer 2020 that I focused on fine-tuning my fitness. A focus on nutrition, recovery, and load balancing. An interest in hybrid athleticism that would continue for years. After hacking my way through 13.1 miles in September, I returned to a focus on lifting. Putting on as much strength as possible. I had no consistency in my running, and probably ran just a few times in 2021 and 2022. I was however, benching 300 lbs, squatting 405 and deadlifting 415.

I started running out of curiosity and necessity. It would complement my lifting, enhance my fitness, and, well, I had to because gyms were closed. My running journey wouldn‚Äôt resume until spring 2023, when I started training for my first Chicago Marathon. That‚Äôs a story for another time.
